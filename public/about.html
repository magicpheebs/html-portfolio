<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a British Citizen living in Portugal. I have had the amazing experience of travelling the world onboard cruise ships and have lived in the UK, New Zealand and now Portugal. </p>

<p>I bring a diverse background in sales, operations, and admissions across various industries such as Real Estate, Recruitment, luxury fine art, SaaS and Ed Tech. 
   My interest in coding came from experience as an Admissions Manager for two very well know coding bootcamps. It was there that I developed a passion for learning to code. 
   During a recent contract as a Data Manager for a coaching company, I specialised in integrating systems and using automation tools to capture data and enhance productivity. 
   This inspired me to seek more formal training to become a skilled web developer</p>

<p>In order to prepare myself as a Web Developer, I have taken the following courses;
  <ul>
    <li>Udemy - The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp
    </li>
    <li>The Code Institute - Intro to Coding</li>
    <li>Sololearn - Intro to Python</li>
    <li>Sololearn - Web Development</li>
  </ul>
